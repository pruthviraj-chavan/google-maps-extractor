## ‚ö° Enlightening Questions

### ‚ùì How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Enter your search queries.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

3. Get the results in 2 minutes, woo hoo! üéâ

![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)


### ‚ùì What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Mainly, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Scrape Reviews 
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)

Please note that you are guaranteed to receive at least **240 reviews** per place. However, in some cases, due to technical limitations, the complete set of reviews may not be available.

#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers in Bangalore" and "Web Developers in Mumbai", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using a really good sorting order, which is as follows ("Best Potential Customers"):

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses more open to technology come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear first.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.


### ‚ùì How many search results can I get in a single query?

Google Maps gives at most 120 results per search query. Don't worry about running out of data, as you can always use country-level scraping to scrape thousands of cities.


### ‚ùì Are there any usage limits?

<!-- 
### ‚ùì How can I get Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. of the places?

While our Google Maps Extractor provides unlimited places with 40+ data points, you may optionally want to use our Website Contact Extractor Addon to get LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and other contact information for the results. 

These details help you reach out to business owners more effectively.

The data quality is excellent. Kindly follow these steps to use the Website Contact Extractor Addon:

1. Sign up on RapidAPI by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up).

![Sign Up on RapidAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/assets/master/images/sign-up.png)

2. Subscribe to the Free Plan by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/Chetan11dev/api/website-social-scraper-api/pricing).

![Subscribe to Free Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/subscribe.png)

3. Copy the API key.
![Copy the API Key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/key.png)

Now you have two options for using the Website Contact Extractor Addon:

#### Option 1: Get contacts for all places in a search query

Enter the copied API key in the "Email and Social Links Extraction" section and run it:

![social-section.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/social-section.png)

#### Option 2: Get contacts for specific chosen websites (saves money)

1. Click the Website Contact Extractor button:
![website-contacts-scraper-button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/website-contacts-scraper-button.png)

2. Enter the specific websites you're interested in, the copied API key, and run it:
![interested-websites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/interested-websites.png)

3. After this, you'll have the contact details for the chosen websites.

![contacts-websites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/contacts-websites.png)

### ‚ùì How much does the Website Contact Extractor Addon cost?

There are 3 plans available:
- Free Plan: 200 places free every month
- $6/1000 Contacts Plan: 1000 places for $6
- $33/10000 Contacts Plan: 10000 places for just $3.33 per 1000

For most users, the Free Plan is sufficient. You can selectively choose the websites you're interested in and use the Website Contacts Extractor to get details for only those chosen websites.

![website-contacts-scraper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/website-contacts-scraper.png)

Although, if you need thousands of contacts, consider the $6/1000 Contacts Plan or $33/10000 Contacts Plan.

The data quality is excellent, and the cost is very reasonable. Considering that landing just one customer from 1000 contacts can easily cover your investment and generate a nice profit. -->

### ‚ùì Do I Need to Do Anything Else to Use the Tool Effectively?

1. Disable Auto Sleep Mode
  Auto sleep mode will prevent the tool from running and cause tasks to fail. Here's how to turn it off:

  - **On Windows**:
      Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **System** > **Power & battery** > **System** > **Screen & Sleep**. Set the following settings to "Never"  
      ![windows-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/windows-sleep.png)

  - **On Mac**:
      Open **Settings** > **Lock Screen**, then set the following settings to "Never."  
      ![mac-sleep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/mac-sleep.png)
  - **Linux?**:  
     You're awesome at computers, so go ahead and figure it out! ;)

2. Ensure you maintain a stable Internet connection, as switching connections will cause currently running tasks to fail.

### ‚ùì This Extractor is Truly One-of-a-Kind, Something I've Never Seen Before. How Did You Build It?

Thank you! We used Botasaurus Desktop, which is the secret behind our awesome Google Maps Extractor.

Botasaurus is a web scraping framework that makes life a lot easier for web scrapers.

It handled the hardest parts of our extractor, such as:

- Building a desktop app for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Creating a fantastic UI dashboard with task management features.
- Sorting, filtering, and exporting data as CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.
- Caching, parallel, and asynchronous scraping.

If you're a web scraper, I really recommend learning about Botasaurus Desktop [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/botasaurus/blob/master/botasaurus-desktop-tutorial.md) üöÄ.

Trust me, learning Botasaurus Desktop will only take 5 minutes, but I guarantee it will definitely save you thousands of hours in your life as a web scraper.

  </a>
</p>

### ‚ùì I previously bought the Python-NodeJS version of the tool. How can I upgrade to the desktop app?

To upgrade from the Python-NodeJS version to the desktop app, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the desktop app from the link provided at the top of this page.

2. Visit the same link that was sent to you in the email after you bought the Pro version.

3. Your Pro version will be activated. Enjoy!

The process is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. If you face any issues or have further questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

### ‚ùì In the exported file, the characters are in English instead of Japanese/Korean/Hindi. How can I preserve the original language when exporting?

When exporting, any non-English characters are converted to English. For example, "„Åó„Çì„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì" is converted to "Shinchan"

We do this because Excel can't render non-English characters properly.

If you want to retain the original characters and avoid converting them to English, simply **uncheck** the English conversion checkbox:

![Uncheck English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/uncheck-english.png)

Also, in case you are unable to view the non-English characters properly in Excel, then the easiest solution is to upload the file to Google Sheets, which should render the characters properly.
